Welcome to my personal **Python Course**! This repository contains material to learn the Python programming language, starting from the basics to more advanced concepts. Each lesson includes `.md` files for theory and may contain `.py` examples
I recommend you to code while you learn.
## Course Structure
The course is divided into 15 lessons, each covering a specific topic:

1. **Introduction to Python**: Installation, environment setup, first program.
2. **Variables and Data Types**: Variable declaration, data types, conversion.
3. **Operators in Python**: Arithmetic, comparison, logical operators.
4. **Strings and String Operations**: String methods, concatenation.
5. **Control Structures**: `if`, `elif`, `else` conditionals.
6. **Loops in Python**: `for` and `while` loops, `range()`, `break`, and `continue`.
7. **Lists and Collections**: Lists, tuples, dictionaries.
8. **Functions**: Definition, parameters, return values.
9. **Modules and Standard Libraries**: Usage of `math`, `random`, `datetime`.
10. **Error Handling**: `try`, `except`, `finally`.
11. **File Handling**: Reading and writing files.
12. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, inheritance.
13. **External Libraries and Virtual Environment**: Installing libraries with `pip`, virtual environments.
14. **Practical Projects**: Developing small practical projects.
15. **Conclusion and Further Resources**: Review, resources for further learning.
